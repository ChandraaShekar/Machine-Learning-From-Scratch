# Machine Learning From Scratch

The main aim is to create macchine learning models from scratch as many as possible. This project would take a long time to finish since I have to learn all the algorithmns before implementation.

I would also try my level best to write a easily understandable code and also give a clear description on how everything is working. So it would help anyone who is planning on learning machine learning. 

I'm also planning on creating a blog and discussions page if anyone is intrested in checking it out.

I would not go into mathematical representations in this repository but that is something I'm still considering to include.

Any contributions are much appreciated. 

## Request for contribution:
- If you want to contribute to this project, you can fork this repository and make a pull request. You can also create an issue if you find any bug or want to suggest any improvement.
- It would be great if you could also add a README.md file in the folder containing the code for your implementation of Linear Regression. This will help us to compare the different implementations of Linear Regression.
- The main goal is to create a repository containing different implementations of Linear Regression in different programming languages. This will help us to understand the working of all the algorithms and optimizers used in Linear Regression.
