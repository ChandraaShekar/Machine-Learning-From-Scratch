# Machine Learning From Scratch

The main aim is to create macchine learning models from scratch as many as possible. This project would take a long time to finish since I have to learn all the algorithmns before implementation.

I would also try my level best to write a easily understandable code and also give a clear description on how everything is working. So it would help anyone who is planning on learning machine learning. 

I'm also planning on creating a blog and discussions page if anyone is intrested in checking it out.

I would not go into mathematical representations in this repository but that is something I'm still considering to include.

Any contributions are much appreciated.
